This repository contains the files of the "BookHub" app developed as a Mobile Application Development project.
This is a Book Catalogue app, which displays number of books along with the current market ratings. The app imports the data from a stable internet source.
The app allows the user to view the book's information and allows to add/remove the books to their favorites as well.

Note:
The gradle files are to be included inside the project root folder.
The src file is to be included inside the Root(Project folder)/app folder.
